This project, **Clicky Ball**, is a simple yet engaging game created as part of the [Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer). In this game, players aim to click on moving balls within a grid-based layout, with three difficulty levels to challenge their reaction speed and accuracy. The project serves as a practical exercise in C# scripting, UI management, and basic game mechanics within the Unity environment.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard modes to adjust the balls' spawn rates.
- **Simple UI Layout:** Minimalist design focused on delivering a straightforward user experience.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding and implementing basic Unity UI elements
